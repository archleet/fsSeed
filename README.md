# Node Full Stack Seed

Based on the [Angular Express Seed](https://github.com/btford/angular-express-seed), This app provides a application framework using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [Mongo Db](http://www.mongodb.org/) and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/). 

This provides a full technology stack framework for creating powerful node-centric applications. The eventual intent is to be able to switch out different parts of the stack for other components based on the requirements of each application.
